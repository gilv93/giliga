# Giliga!
Welcome to Giliga, my first ever project I pushed to Github!

Creating this game was a lot of fun and helped really spark my interest in programming.

## Pygame
You will need to install the Pyagme library to run this game! Instructions on how to do this are given below.

Pygame was a great learning tool when it came to understanding classes and helped to get a basic feel for Python's syntax.

## How to run
1. To run this game you will need to download [Python 3](https://www.python.org).
2. Make a new folder in whatever location you'd like to install it in and run `git clone https://github.com/gilv93/giliga` in your terminal of choice.
3. Run `pip install -U pygame --user` to install pygames locally.
4. Run `python3 giliga.py`.
5. Enjoy!
